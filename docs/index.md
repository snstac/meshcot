MeshCOT is software for monitoring and analyzing Direct Remote Identification (DRI), Remote ID (RID) or Open Drone ID (ODID) broadcasts from Uncrewed Aircraft (UA) via the [Team Awareness Kit (TAK)](https://www.tak.gov) ecosystem of products.

MeshCOT captures & reports real-time data received from drones into TAK products using native TAK protocols, including Cursor on Target (CoT). 

MeshCOT has been evaluated with WinTAK, iTAK, ATAK & TAK Server.

MeshCOT is in active use today in a variety of missions.
